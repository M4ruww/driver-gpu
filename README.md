Configuring a GPU using code requires advanced knowledge of GPU programming and CUDA. It's important to refer to the official documentation and guidelines provided by NVIDIA and PyCUDA when working with GPUs to ensure proper and safe usage. Also, please note that modifying GPU settings can potentially impact the performance, stability, and warranty of the GPU, so proceed with caution and at your own risk.
